# Spherely Documentation

Manipulation and analysis of geometric objects on the sphere.

Spherely is the counterpart of [Shapely] (2.0+) for manipulation and analysis
of spherical geometric objects. It is using the widely deployed open-source
geometry library [s2geometry] via the library [s2geography] which provides a
[GEOS] compatibility layer on top of s2geometry.

**This library is at an early stage of development.**
